</div></article><div class="para" id="atomic-molecular-statements-4"> The reason the sentence “<span class="process-math">\(3 + x = 12\)</span>” is not a statement is that it contains a variable. Depending on what <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the <em class="emphasis">sentence</em> into a <em class="emphasis">statement</em> is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, “<span class="process-math">\(3+x = 12\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x = 9\text{,}\)</span>” which is a true statement. Or you could <em class="emphasis">capture</em> the free variable by <em class="emphasis">quantifying</em> over it, as in, “for all values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3+x = 12\text{,}\)</span>” which is false. We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.</div>
<div class="para" id="atomic-molecular-statements-5"> You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using <dfn class="terminology">logical connectives</dfn>. For example, this is a molecular statement:</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="atomic-molecular-statements-6"><div class="para" id="atomic-molecular-statements-6-1">Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.</div></blockquote>
<div class="para" id="atomic-molecular-statements-7"> Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are <em class="emphasis">connected</em> by an “and.” We will consider 5 connectives: “and” (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), “or” (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), “if…, then…” (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), “if and only if” (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and “not” (Sam is not a man). The first four are called <dfn class="terminology">binary connectives</dfn> (because they connect two statements) while “not” is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">unary connective</dfn> (since it applies to a single statement).</div>
<div class="para" id="atomic-molecular-statements-8"> These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which <dfn class="terminology">truth value</dfn> the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider <dfn class="terminology">propositional variables</dfn> (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">sentential</em> variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: <span class="process-math">\(P, Q, R, S, \ldots\text{.}\)</span> We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two <em class="emphasis">values</em> the variables can achieve: true or false.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="atomic-molecular-statements-8-11"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="atomic-molecular-statements-8-11">In computer programming, we should call such variables <dfn class="terminology">Boolean variables</dfn>.</div></details> We also have symbols for the logical connectives: <span class="process-math">\(\wedge\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vee\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\imp\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\iff\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\neg\text{.}\)</span>

Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the <em class="emphasis">Pythagorean Theorem</em>. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as “<span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span>” This is absolutely not correct.

So <span class="process-math">\(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\text{???}\)</span> How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the legs of a right triangle and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the hypotenuse.

<div class="para">For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> be <span class="process-math">\(x-1\text{?}\)</span> But here is the problem: what if <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{?}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(y = -1\)</span> and that is <em class="emphasis">not a number!</em> (in our domain of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers. In symbols,</div>

<section class="paragraphs" id="pars-implicituantifiers"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Implicit Quantifiers.</span></h4>  <div class="para" id="pars-implicituantifiers-4">It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics.  Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention.  An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.</div> <div class="para logical" id="pars-implicituantifiers-5">
<div class="para">For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: <span class="process-math">\(S(x)\)</span> standing for “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a square” and <span class="process-math">\(R(x)\)</span> standing for “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a rectangle”.  The <em class="emphasis">sentence</em> we are looking at is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
S(x) \imp R(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement.  But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and this is what our convention tells us to consider.</div>
</div> <div class="para" id="pars-implicituantifiers-6">Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement.  For example, we might write, <em class="emphasis">let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the <em class="emphasis">statement</em>, “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime,”</em> which is technically incorrect.  It is implicit that we mean that we are defining <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> to be a predicate, which for each <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> becomes the statement, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime.</div></section></section><section class="exercises" id="exercises_intro-statements"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
