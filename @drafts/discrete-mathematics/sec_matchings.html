In practice we will assume that <span class="process-math">\(|A| = |B|\)</span> (the two sets have the same number of vertices) so this says that every vertex in the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the matching.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="sec_matchings-8-14"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 4.10"><sup> 10 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="sec_matchings-8-14">Note: what we are calling a <em class="emphasis">matching</em> is sometimes called a <em class="emphasis">perfect matching</em> or <em class="emphasis">complete matching</em>.

<div class="para" id="sec_matchings-9">Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as representing students in a class, and the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> as representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(b \in B\)</span> if student <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> would like to present on topic <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{:}\)</span> you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="sec_matchings-9-8"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 4.11"><sup> 11 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="sec_matchings-9-8">The standard example for matchings used to be the <em class="emphasis">marriage problem</em> in which <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> consisted of the men in the town, <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties. A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed. We have chosen a more progressive context for the sake of political correctness.</div></details>

<div class="para" id="sec_matchings-10">The question is: when does a bipartite graph contain a matching of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span> To begin to answer this question, consider what could prevent the graph from containing a matching. This will not necessarily tell us a condition when the graph <em class="emphasis">does</em> have a matching, but at least it is a start.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_matchings-11">One way <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> not adjacent to any vertex in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (so having degree 0). What else? What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them. Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this way with more and more students. </div>
<div class="para" id="sec_matchings-12">It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> students who as a group like <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> or fewer topics, then no matching is possible. This is true for any value of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and any group of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> students.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_matchings-13"> To make this more graph-theoretic, say you have a set <span class="process-math">\(S \subseteq A\)</span> of vertices.
