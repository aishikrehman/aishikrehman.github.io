For example, you could try to really understand just complete graphs or just bipartite graphs, instead of trying to understand all graphs in general. That is what we are going to do now, looking at <em class="emphasis">trees</em>. Hopefully by the end of this section we will have a better understanding of this class of graph, and also understand why it is important enough to warrant its own section.</div> <article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="sec_trees-2-3"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Definition of a Tree.</span></h3>

Note that this means that a connected forest is a tree.</div></article> <div class="para" id="sec_trees-2-4">Does the definition above agree with your intuition for what graphs we should call trees? Try thinking of examples of trees and make sure they satisfy the definition. One thing to keep in mind is that while the trees we study in graph theory are related to trees you might see in other subjects, the correspondence is not exact. For instance, in anthropology, you might study family trees, like the one below,</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/family-tree.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt='A family tree with "Me" at the top, branching down to the left to "Mom" and to the right to "Dad".

If you trace the tree back from you to that common ancestor, then down through your other grandparent, you would have a cycle, and thus the graph would not be a tree.</div> <div class="para" id="sec_trees-2-7">You might also have seen something called a <em class="emphasis">decision tree</em> (such as the algorithm for deciding whether a series converges or diverges). Sometimes these too contain cycles, as the decision for one node might lead you back to a previous step.</div> <div class="para" id="sec_trees-2-8"> Both the examples of trees above also have another feature worth mentioning: there is a clear order to the vertices in the tree. In general, there is no reason for a tree to have this added structure, although we can impose such a structure by considering <dfn class="terminology">rooted trees</dfn>, where we simply designate one vertex as the <em class="emphasis">root</em>. We will consider such trees in more detail later in this section.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="sec_trees-3"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="para" id="subsec-rooted-trees-4">So far, we have thought of trees only as a particular kind of graph. However, it is often useful to add additional structure to trees to help solve problems. Data is often structured like a tree. This book, for example, has a tree structure: draw a vertex for the book itself. Then draw vertices for each chapter, connected to the book vertex. Under each chapter, draw a vertex for each section, connecting it to the chapter it belongs to. The graph will not have any cycles; it will be a tree. But a tree with clear hierarchy which is not present if we don’t identify the book vertex as the “top”.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-rooted-trees-5"> As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the <dfn class="terminology">root</dfn>, then every other vertex on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the root.  This works because there is a unique path between any two vertices in a tree.  So from any vertex, we can travel back to the root in exactly one way.  This also allows us to describe how distinct vertices in a rooted tree are related.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-rooted-trees-6"> If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn> of the other, which is called the <dfn class="terminology">child</dfn> of the parent.  Of the two, the parent is the vertex that is closer to the root.  Thus the root of a tree is a parent, but is not the child of any vertex (and is unique in this respect: all non-root vertices have <em class="emphasis">exactly one</em> parent).</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-rooted-trees-7"> Not surprisingly, the child of a child of a vertex is called the <dfn class="terminology">grandchild</dfn> of the vertex (and it is the <dfn class="terminology">grandparent</dfn>).

We chose to visit all vertices in the same generation before any vertices of the next generation.

<div class="para" id="subsec-rooted-trees-13"> In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order.  Start with the root, put it in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  Then look for one child of the root to put in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  Then find a child of that vertex, into <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and then find its child, into <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and so on.  When you get to a vertex with no children, retreat to its parent and see if the parent has any other children.
