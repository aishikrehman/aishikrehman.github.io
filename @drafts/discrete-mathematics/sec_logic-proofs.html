Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don’t have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that “Goldbach’s Conjecture” holds for all numbers less than <span class="process-math">\(4\times 10^{18}\text{,}\)</span> which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).</div> <div class="para" id="sec_logic-proofs-2-3">Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique. Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.</div> <article class="theorem theorem-like" id="sec_logic-proofs-2-4"><h3 class="heading">
