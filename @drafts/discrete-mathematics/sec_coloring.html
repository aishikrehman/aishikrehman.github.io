<div class="para" id="sec_coloring-2-1-1">Mapmakers in the fictional land of Euleria have drawn the borders of the various dukedoms of the land. To make the map pretty, they wish to color each region. Adjacent regions must be colored differently, but it is perfectly fine to color two distant regions with the same color. What is the fewest colors the mapmakers can use and still accomplish this task?</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/sec_coloring-2-1-2.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt='An abstract drawing of a "map" of regions separated by slightly curved borders.  The map contains an outer ring of seven regions (all different sizes), an inner ring of five more regions, and a final odd shaped center region.'></div></article> <div class="para" id="sec_coloring-2-2">Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.</div> <blockquote class="blockquote" id="sec_coloring-2-3"><div class="para" id="sec_coloring-2-3-1">Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?</div></blockquote> <div class="para" id="sec_coloring-2-4">Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will work for any map.</div> <div class="para" id="sec_coloring-2-5">How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.</div> <div class="para" id="sec_coloring-2-6"> In general, given any graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> a coloring of the vertices is called (not surprisingly) a <dfn class="terminology">vertex coloring</dfn>. If the vertex coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called <dfn class="terminology">proper</dfn>. Every graph has a proper vertex coloring. For example, you could color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better. The smallest number of colors needed to get a proper vertex coloring is called the <dfn class="terminology">chromatic number</dfn> of the graph, written <span class="process-math">\(\chi(G)\)</span>  .</div> <article class="example example-like" id="sec_coloring-2-7"><h3 class="heading">
