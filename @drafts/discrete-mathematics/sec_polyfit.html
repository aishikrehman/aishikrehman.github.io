<div class="para" id="sec_polyfit-3-1-1">A standard <span class="process-math">\(8 \times 8\)</span> chessboard contains 64 squares. Actually, this is just the number of unit squares. How many squares of all sizes are there on a chessboard? Start with smaller boards: <span class="process-math">\(1\times 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\text{,}\)</span> etc. Find a formula for the total number of squares in an <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> board.</div></article> <div class="para" id="sec_polyfit-3-2">So far we have seen methods for finding the closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences. Since we know how to compute the sum of the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences, we can compute the closed formulas for sequences which have an arithmetic (or geometric) sequence of differences between terms. But what if we consider a sequence which is the sum of the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms of a sequence which is itself the sum of an arithmetic sequence?</div> <div class="para logical" id="sec_polyfit-3-3">
<div class="para"> Before we get too carried away, let’s consider an example: How many squares (of all sizes) are there on a chessboard? A chessboard consists of <span class="process-math">\(64\)</span> squares, but we also want to consider squares of longer side length. Even though we are only considering an <span class="process-math">\(8 \times 8\)</span> board, there is already a lot to count. So instead, let us build a sequence: the first term will be the number of squares on a <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 1\)</span> board, the second term will be the number of squares on a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> board, and so on. After a little thought, we arrive at the sequence</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
1,5,14,30, 55,\ldots\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">This sequence is not arithmetic (or geometric for that matter), but perhaps it’s sequence of differences is. For differences we get</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
4, 9, 16, 25, \ldots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical" id="sec_polyfit-3-5">
<div class="para">Not a huge surprise: one way to count the number of squares in a <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4\)</span> chessboard is to notice that there are <span class="process-math">\(16\)</span> squares with side length 1, 9 with side length 2, 4 with side length 3 and 1 with side length 4. So the original sequence is just the sum of squares. Now this sequence of differences is not arithmetic since it’s sequence of differences (the differences of the differences of the original sequence) is not constant. In fact, this sequence of <dfn class="terminology">second differences</dfn> is </div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
5, 7, 9, \ldots\text{,}

<div class="para">which <em class="emphasis">is</em> an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2). Notice that our original sequence had <dfn class="terminology">third differences</dfn> (that is, differences of differences of differences of the original) constant. We will call such a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^3\)</span>-constant. The sequence <span class="process-math">\(1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\)</span> has second differences constant, so it will be a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant sequence. In general, we will say a sequence is a <dfn class="terminology"><span class="process-math">\(\Delta^k\)</span>-constant</dfn>  sequence if the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th differences are constant.</div>

The <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^1\)</span>-constant sequences are arithmetic and we have a method for finding closed formulas for them as well. Every <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant sequence is the sum of an arithmetic sequence so we can find formulas for these as well. But notice that the format of the closed formula for a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant sequence is always quadratic. For example, the square numbers are <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant with closed formula <span class="process-math">\(a_n= n^2\text{.}\)</span> The triangular numbers (also <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant) have closed formula <span class="process-math">\(a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\text{,}\)</span> which when multiplied out gives you an <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> term as well. It appears that every time we increase the complexity of the sequence, that is, increase the number of differences before we get constants, we also increase the degree of the polynomial used for the closed formula. We go from constant to linear to quadratic. The sequence of differences between terms tells us something about the rate of growth of the sequence. If a sequence is growing at a constant rate, then the formula for the sequence will be linear. If the sequence is growing at a rate which itself is growing at a constant rate, then the formula is quadratic. You have seen this elsewhere: if a function has a constant second derivative (rate of change) then the function must be quadratic.</div> <div class="para" id="sec_polyfit-3-8">This works in general:</div> <article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="sec_polyfit-3-9"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Finite Differences.</span></h3>
