<div class="para" id="subsec_patternsPascal-14-2-1">The easiest way to see this is to consider bit strings. <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> is the number of bit strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1’s. Of all of these strings, some start with a 1 and the rest start with a 0. First consider all the bit strings which start with a 1. After the 1, there must be <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> more bits (to get the total length up to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) and exactly <span class="process-math">\(k-1\)</span> of them must be 1’s (as we already have one, and we need <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> total). How many strings are there like that? There are exactly <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}\)</span> such bit strings, so of all the length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> bit strings containing <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1’s, <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}\)</span> of them start with a 1. Similarly, there are <span class="process-math">\({n-1\choose k}\)</span> which start with a 0 (we still need <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> bits and now <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of them must be 1’s). Since there are <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k}\)</span> bit strings containing <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> bits with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1’s, that is the number of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> bit strings with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1’s which start with a 0.

</div> <div class="para" id="subsec_patternsPascal-14-2-2">Another way: consider the question, how many ways can you select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> pizza toppings from a menu containing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices? One way to do this is just <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\text{.}\)</span> Another way to answer the same question is to first decide whether or not you want anchovies. If you do want anchovies, you still need to pick <span class="process-math">\(k-1\)</span> toppings, now from just <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> choices. That can be done in <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}\)</span> ways. If you do not want anchovies, then you still need to select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings from <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> choices (the anchovies are out). You can do that in <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k}\)</span> ways.

Both of these ways give you a pizza with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings.

<div class="para" id="subsec_moreProofs-2"> The explanatory proofs given in the above examples are typically called <dfn class="terminology">combinatorial proofs</dfn>. In general, to give a combinatorial proof for a binomial identity, say <span class="process-math">\(A = B\)</span> you do the following:</div>

</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec_moreProofs-5">The tricky thing is coming up with the question. This is not always obvious, but it gets easier the more counting problems you solve. You will start to recognize types of answers as the answers to types of questions. More often what will happen is you will be solving a counting problem and happen to think up two different ways of finding the answer. Now you have a binomial identity and the proof is right there. The proof <em class="emphasis">is</em> the problem you just solved together with your two solutions.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec_moreProofs-6">For example, consider this counting question:</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="subsec_moreProofs-7"><div class="para" id="subsec_moreProofs-7-1">How many 10-letter words use exactly four A’s, three B’s, two C’s and one D?</div></blockquote>
<div class="para logical" id="subsec_moreProofs-8">
<div class="para">Let’s try to solve this problem. We have 10 spots for letters to go. Four of those need to be A’s. We can pick the four A-spots in <span class="process-math">\({10 \choose 4}\)</span> ways. Now where can we put the B’s? Well there are only 6 spots left, we need to pick <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> of them. This can be done in <span class="process-math">\({6 \choose 3}\)</span> ways. The two C’s need to go in two of the 3 remaining spots, so we have <span class="process-math">\({3 \choose 2}\)</span> ways of doing that. That leaves just one spot of the D, but we could write that 1 choice as <span class="process-math">\({1 \choose 1}\text{.}\)</span> Thus the answer is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{10 \choose 4}{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}{1 \choose 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical" id="subsec_moreProofs-9">
<div class="para">But why stop there? We can find the answer another way too. First let’s decide where to put the one D: we have 10 spots, we need to choose 1 of them, so this can be done in <span class="process-math">\({10 \choose 1}\)</span> ways. Next, choose one of the <span class="process-math">\({9 \choose 2}\)</span> ways to place the two C’s. We now have <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> spots left, and three of them need to be filled with B’s. There are <span class="process-math">\({7 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to do this. Finally the A’s can be placed in <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 4}\)</span> (that is, only one) ways. So another answer to the question is</div>
