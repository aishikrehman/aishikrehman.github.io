<div class="para" id="sec_planar-4-4">Notice that since <span class="process-math">\(8 - 12 + 6 = 2\text{,}\)</span> the vertices, edges and faces of a cube satisfy Euler’s formula for planar graphs.

<div class="para" id="sec_planar-4-6">In fact, <em class="emphasis">every</em> convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges crossing. Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with a light at the center of the sphere. The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the interior of the sphere. You can then cut a hole in the sphere in the middle of one of the projected faces and “stretch” the sphere to lie down flat on the plane. The face that was punctured becomes the “outside” face of the planar graph.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_planar-4-7">The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular planar graphs) to convex polyhedra. Since every convex polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph, we see that Euler’s formula for planar graphs holds for all convex polyhedra as well. We also can apply the same sort of reasoning we use for graphs in other contexts to convex polyhedra. For example, we know that there is no convex polyhedron with 11 vertices all of degree 3, as this would make 33/2 edges.</div>
