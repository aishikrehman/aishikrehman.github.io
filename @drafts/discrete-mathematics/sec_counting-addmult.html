                        each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain. To determine a
                        function, we just need to specify the image of each element in the domain. Where can we
                        send 1? There are 4 choices. Where can we send 2? Again, 4 choices. What we have here is
                        5 “events” (picking the image of an element in the domain) each of which can happen in 4
                        ways (the choices for that image). Thus there are <span class="process-math">\(4 \cdot 4

                        principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects: functions. Whenever we have a

        How would you convince someone they are correct? This is surprisingly difficult. They seem so simple, so

    <div class="para" id="subsec_countingWithSets-3">To make things clearer, and more mathematically rigorous,
        we will use sets. Do not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying to give a proof of
        these principles, but we are doing a lot more. If we understand the additive and multiplicative
        principles rigorously, we will be better at applying them, and knowing when and when not to apply them
        at all.</div>
    <div class="para" id="subsec_countingWithSets-4">We will look at the additive and multiplicative principles

                        in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want <span
                            class="process-math">\(|S \cup P|\text{,}\)</span> the number of elements in the

                        (since there is no overlap; <span class="process-math">\(|S \cap P| = 0\)</span>).
                        Question 1 is slightly more complicated. Your first guess might be to find <span

                        shirt and a pair of pants. Instead, we want one of each. We could think of this as
                        asking how many pairs <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> there are, where <span
                            class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a shirt and <span
                            class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a pair of pants. As we will soon verify, this
