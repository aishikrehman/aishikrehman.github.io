</div></article><div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-3">Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph is.  		While we almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected by lines) this is fairly ambiguous. Do the lines need to be straight? Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are? Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots? Can one line connect three dots?</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-4">The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous <em class="emphasis">definitions</em>. Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important. The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed. Is there a graph with no edges? We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-5">We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying. It needs to be useful: we <em class="emphasis">could</em> define a graph to be a six legged mammal, but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges. Instead, here is the (now) standard definition of a graph.</div>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="sec_gt-intro-6"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Graph Definition.</span></h3>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-6-7">A <dfn class="terminology">graph</dfn> is an ordered pair <span class="process-math">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> consisting of a nonempty set <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> (called the <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn>) and a set <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> (called the <dfn class="terminology">edges</dfn>) of two-element subsets of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Strange. Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines. From the definition, a graph could be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(\{a,b,c,d\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\}\})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Here we have a graph with four vertices (the letters <span class="process-math">\(a, b, c, d\)</span>) and five edges (the pairs <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\})\)</span>).</div>
</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-8"> Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process. That is why we often draw a representation of these sets. We put a dot down for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges. Thus one way to draw the graph described above is this:</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 20%; margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/sec_gt-intro-9.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Four vertices arranged in a square, with edges on the border of the square and one connecting the bottom left vertex to the top right vertex.  Vertices are labeled a (top left), b (top right), c (bottom left) and d (bottom right)."></div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-10">However we could also have drawn the graph differently. For example either of these:</div>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:13.75%;margin-right:13.75%;">

</div></div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-12">We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be “the same.” Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal? Are the edge sets equal? We know what it means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.</div>

</div></article><div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-32"> Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">simple</dfn>, although we will just call them <em class="emphasis">graphs</em>. This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn’t make sense to say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-33"> That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges and single edge loops. For example, the “graph” we drew for the Bridges of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore. We will call these objects <dfn class="terminology">multigraphs</dfn>. This is a good name: a <em class="emphasis">multiset</em> is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-34"> The graphs above are also <dfn class="terminology">connected</dfn>: you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges. A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together. For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{:}\)</span>

The vertex on the far left is labeled a and the vertex on the far right is labeled b."></div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-36"> Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called <dfn class="terminology">complete</dfn>. That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name: <span class="process-math">\(K_n\)</span>  is the complete graph on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-37"> Each vertex in <span class="process-math">\(K_n\)</span> is adjacent to <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> other vertices. We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the <dfn class="terminology">degree</dfn> of that vertex. So every vertex in <span class="process-math">\(K_n\)</span> has degree <span class="process-math">\(n-1\text{.}\)</span> How many edges does <span class="process-math">\(K_n\)</span> have? One might think the answer should be <span class="process-math">\(n(n-1)\text{,}\)</span> since we count <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> edges <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> times (once for each vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice. Thus there are <span class="process-math">\(n(n-1)/2\)</span> edges in <span class="process-math">\(K_n\text{.}\)</span> Alternatively, we can say there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 2}\)</span> edges, since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_gt-intro-38">In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges.
