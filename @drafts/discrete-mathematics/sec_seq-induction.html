        </details> In other words, induction is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a
        mathematical statement is always true. Many mathematical statements can be proved by simply explaining what
        they mean. Others are very difficult to prove—in fact, there are relatively simple mathematical statements
        which nobody yet knows how to prove. To facilitate the discovery of proofs, it is important to be familiar
        with some standard styles of arguments. Induction is one such style. Let’s start with an example:</div>

      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-stamps-3">Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some
        amounts of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent

        on. If this is what you did, you were actually answering a <em class="emphasis">sequence</em> of questions.
        We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let’s see if that helps.</div>

          one 5-cent stamp), and so on.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-stamps-5">Let’s think a bit about how we could find the value of <span
          class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> for some specific <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (the
        “value” will be either <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>).
        How did we find the value of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term of a sequence of numbers?
        How did we find <span class="process-math">\(a_n\text{?}\)</span> There were two ways we could do this:
        either there was a closed formula for <span class="process-math">\(a_n\text{,}\)</span> so we could plug in
        <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> into the formula and get our output value, or we had a recursive
        definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the <span
          class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term. When dealing with sequences of statements, we could use either
        of these techniques as well. Maybe there is a way to use <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> itself to
        determine whether we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage. That would be
        something like a closed formula. Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements)
        to determine whether we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage. That is, if we
        know the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n-1)\text{,}\)</span> can we get from that to the value of
        <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\text{?}\)</span> That would be something like a recursive definition for
        the sequence. Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed
        formulas. The same is true here.

      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-stamps-6">Suppose I told you that <span
          class="process-math">\(P(43)\)</span> was true (it is). Can you determine from this fact the value of
        <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if we don’t know
        how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps, we do know that there was some way to do
        it. What if that way used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace those three
        5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way
        to make 44 cents, so <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> is true. Of course, we assumed that we had
        at least three 5-cent stamps. What if we didn’t? Then we must have at least three 8-cent stamps (making 24
        cents). If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have
        bumped up our total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents, so <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> is
        true.

      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-stamps-7">Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that
        we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make 43 cents? Perhaps because we know
        we can make <span class="process-math">\(42\)</span> cents, which we know we can do because we know we can
        make 41 cents, and so on. It’s a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence, we must
        specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is “<span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is
        false.” That’s not good, since our recurrence relation just says that <span

      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-formproofs-2">What we did in the stamp example above works for many
        types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers,
        or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other
        situations too. In particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the
        next – when you can see how to always “do one more.”</div>
      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-formproofs-3">This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem <em
          class="emphasis">inductively</em> can give new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand
        the stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage (greater than 28 cents) can be made
        (this is non-inductive reasoning) and also how the ways in which postage can be made <em
          class="emphasis">changes</em> as the amount increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide
        a proof by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem <em class="emphasis">dynamically</em>;
        how does increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> change the problem?</div>
      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-formproofs-4">But there is another side to proofs by induction as well.
        In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem, you must also be able to communicate the problem
        to others. Like any discipline, mathematics has standard language and style, allowing mathematicians to
        share their ideas efficiently. Proofs by induction have a certain formal style, and being able to write in
        this style is important. It allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us with formulating a
        proof.</div>

        allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid. Why does induction work? Think of
        a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges. We want to argue that in a minute, all the dominoes will
        have fallen down. For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino. That is the base case. It will
        also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will
        cause the next domino to fall. That is the inductive case. If both of these conditions are met, you push the
        first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall, then all the dominoes will fall.</div>
      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-formproofs-9">Induction is powerful! Think how much easier it is to
        knock over dominoes when you don’t have to push over each domino yourself. You just start the chain
        reaction, and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.</div>
      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-formproofs-10">Think about our study of sequences. It is easier to find
        recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas. Going from one case to the next is easier than
        going directly to a particular case. That is what is so great about induction. Instead of going directly to
        the (arbitrary) case for <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we just need to say how to get from
        one case to the next.</div>

        induction, you should first think about <em class="emphasis">why</em> the statement is true, using inductive

                might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to <span
                  class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If we know how to do that, adding just one more term
                (<span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span>) would not be that hard. For example, if <span
                  class="process-math">\(n = 100\text{,}\)</span> suppose we know that the sum of the first 100
                numbers is <span class="process-math">\(5050\)</span> (so <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 +
                  \cdots + 100 = 5050\text{,}\)</span> which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers,
                it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would
                have <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 =

                multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new

        <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-examples-10-4">Still you might start to believe that you can prove
          anything with induction. Consider this incorrect “proof” that every Canadian has the same eye color: Let

          Canadians have the same eye color. <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true, since everyone has the
          same eye color as themselves. Now

        started with a <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 4\)</span> bar, we have choices for our first break. We
        could break the bar in half, creating two <span class="process-math">\(1\times 2\)</span> bars, or we could
        break off a single square, leaving a <span class="process-math">\(1\times 3\)</span> bar. But either way, we

      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-strong-22">Whether you use regular induction or strong induction
        depends on the statement you want to prove. If you wanted to be safe, you could always use strong induction.
        It really is <em class="emphasis">stronger</em>, so can accomplish everything “weak” induction can. That
        said, using regular induction is often easier since there is only one place you can use the induction
        hypothesis. There is also something to be said for <em class="emphasis">elegance</em> in proofs. If you can
        prove a statement using simpler tools, it is nice to do so.</div>
      <div class="para" id="subsec_induction-strong-23"> As a final contrast between the two forms of induction,
        consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one
        cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent
        stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show <em
          class="emphasis">five</em> base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would
        actually say how each of these is made). Now assume that it is possible to make <span
          class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents of postage for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\)</span>
        as long as <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{.}\)</span> As long as <span class="process-math">\(n
          &gt; 32\text{,}\)</span> this means in particular we can make <span class="process-math">\(k =
          n-5\)</span> cents. Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents.

                that the sum is the entry below and to the left of the last of these 5 entries. Note that if this is
                true, and we instead add up the first 6 entries, we will need to add the entry one spot to the right
                of the previous sum. But these two together give the entry below them, which is below and left of
                the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal. If you follow that, you can see what is going on. But it
                is not a great proof. A formal induction proof is needed.</div>
