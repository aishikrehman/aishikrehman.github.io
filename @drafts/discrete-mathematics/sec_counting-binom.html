<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-3-4">Subsets should be familiar, otherwise read over <a href="sec_intro-sets.html" class="internal" title="Section 0.3: Sets">Section 0.3</a> again. Suppose we look at the set <span class="process-math">\(A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}\text{.}\)</span> How many subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contain exactly 3 elements?</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-3-5">First, a simpler question: How many subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are there total? In other words, what is <span class="process-math">\(|\pow(A)|\)</span> (the cardinality of the power set of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>)? Think about how we would build a subset. We need to decide, for each of the elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> whether or not to include the element in our subset. So we need to decide “yes” or “no” for the element 1. And for each choice we make, we need to decide “yes” or “no” for the element 2. And so on. For each of the 5 elements, we have 2 choices. Therefore the number of subsets is simply <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2\cdot 2 = 2^5\)</span> (by the multiplicative principle).</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-3-6">Of those 32 subsets, how many have 3 elements? This is not obvious. Note that we cannot just use the multiplicative principle. Maybe we want to say we have 2 choices (yes/no) for the first element, 2 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and then only 1 choice for the other two. But what if we said “no” to one of the first three elements? Then we would have two choices for the 4th element. What a mess!</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-3-7">Another (bad) idea: we need to pick three elements to be in our subset. There are 5 elements to choose from. So there are 5 choices for the first element, and for each of those 4 choices for the second, and then 3 for the third (last) element. The multiplicative principle would say then that there are a total of <span class="process-math">\(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60\)</span> ways to select the 3-element subset. But this cannot be correct (<span class="process-math">\(60 &gt; 32\)</span> for one thing). One of the outcomes we would get from these choices would be the set <span class="process-math">\(\{3,2,5\}\text{,}\)</span> by choosing the element 3 first, then the element 2, then the element 5. Another outcome would be <span class="process-math">\(\{5,2,3\}\)</span> by choosing the element 5 first, then the element 2, then the element 3. But these are the same set! We can correct this by dividing: for each set of three elements, there are 6 outcomes counted among our 60 (since there are 3 choices for which element we list first, 2 for which we list second, and 1 for which we list last). So we expect there to be 10 3-element subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-3-8">Is this right? Well, we could list out all 10 of them, being very systematic in doing so, to make sure we don’t miss any or list any twice. Or we could try to count how many subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> <em class="emphasis">don’t</em> have 3 elements in them. How many have no elements? Just 1 (the empty set). How many have 5? Again, just 1. These are the cases in which we say “no” to all elements, or “yes” to all elements. Okay, what about the subsets which contain a single element? There are 5 of these. We must say “yes” to exactly one element, and there are 5 to choose from. This is also the number of subsets containing 4 elements. Those are the ones for which we must say “no” to exactly one element.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-3-9">So far we have counted 12 of the 32 subsets. We have not yet counted the subsets with cardinality 2 and with cardinality 3. There are a total of 20 subsets left to split up between these two groups. But the number of each must be the same! If we say “yes” to exactly two elements, that can be accomplished in exactly the same number of ways as the number of ways we can say “no” to exactly two elements. So the number of 2-element subsets is equal to the number of 3-element subsets. Together there are 20 of these subsets, so 10 each.</div>

<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-4-7">The counting questions: How many bit strings have length 5? How many of those have weight 3? In other words, we are asking for the cardinalities <span class="process-math">\(|\B^5|\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|\B^5_3|\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-4-8">To find the number of 5-bit strings is straight forward. We have 5 bits, and each can either be a 0 or a 1.

<div class="para logical" id="sec_counting-binom-4-9">
<div class="para">Finding the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is harder. Think about how such a string could start. The first bit must be either a 0 or a 1. In the first case (the string starts with a 0), we must then decide on four more bits. To have a total of three 1’s, among those four remaining bits there must be three 1’s. To count all of these strings, we must include all 4-bit strings of weight 3. In the second case (the string starts with a 1), we still have four bits to choose, but now only two of them can be 1’s, so we should look at all the 4-bit strings of weight 2. So the strings in <span class="process-math">\(\B^5_3\)</span> all have the form <span class="process-math">\(1\B^4_2\)</span> (that is, a 1 followed by a string from <span class="process-math">\(\B^4_2\)</span>) or <span class="process-math">\(0\B^4_3\text{.}\)</span> These two sets are disjoint, so we can use the additive principle:</div>

<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-4-11">We can keep going down, but this should be good enough. Both <span class="process-math">\(\B^3_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\B^3_2\)</span> contain 3 bit strings: we must pick one of the three bits to be a 1 (three ways to do that) or one of the three bits to be a 0 (three ways to do that).

<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-4-12"> But wait —32 and 10 were the answers to the counting questions about subsets. Coincidence? Not at all. Each bit string can be thought of as a <em class="emphasis">code</em> for a subset.

<div class="para" id="sec_counting-binom-4-13">For example, the bit string <span class="process-math">\(11001\)</span> represents the subset <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,5\}\)</span> since the first, second and fifth bits are 1’s.

<div class="para">We still need the coefficients of <span class="process-math">\(x^3y^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^2y^3\text{.}\)</span> In both cases, we need to pick exactly 3 of the 5 binomials to contribute one variable, the other two to contribute the other. Wait. This sounds familiar. We have 5 things, each can be one of two things, and we need a total of 3 of one of them. That’s just like taking 5 bits and making sure exactly 3 of them are 1’s. So the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(x^3y^2\)</span> (and also <span class="process-math">\(x^2y^3\)</span>) will be exactly the same as the number of bit strings of length 5 and weight 3, which we found earlier to be 10. So we have:</div>
