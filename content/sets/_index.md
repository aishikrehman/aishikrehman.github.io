## Sets and elements. 
By a set we intuitively mean a collection of objects of any nature (numbers, people, concepts, sets themselves, etc.) that is considered as a single entity. The objects in
that collection are called elements of the set. If an object x is an element of a set A, we denote
that fact by
\(x∈a\) 
otherwise we write
\(x∉a\) 

We also say that \(x\) is a member of the set \(A\) or that \(x\) belongs to \(A\). If a set has finitely many elements (here we rely on your intuition of what finite is), we can describe it precisely by listing all of them, for example:
\(A= \{3,4,5\}\)
We often rely on our common intuition and use ellipses, as in
\(A= \{1,2,...,n\}\)

We sometimes go further and use the same for infinite sets; for example, the set of natural
numbers can be specified as
\(N= \{1,2,...,n\}\)
Further we will discuss a more universal method of describing sets.

## Equality and containment of sets

Two sets are declared equal if and only if they have the
same elements. In other words, the sets A and B are equal, denoted as usual by A = B, if every
element of A is an element of B and every element of B is an element of A. For example, the
sets {a‚ b‚ c} and {b‚ c‚ a} are equal, and so are the sets {1‚ 9‚ 9‚ 7}, {1‚ 9‚ 7} and {7‚ 1‚ 9‚ 1‚ 7‚ 1}.
A set A is a subset of a set B, denoted A ⊆ B, if every element of A is an element of B. If
A ⊆ B, we also say that A is included in B, or that B contains A. For example, {3‚ 5} ⊆ {5‚ 4‚ 3}.
Note that every set is a subset of itself.
The following facts are very useful. They are direct consequences of the definitions of
equality and containment of sets.
• Two sets A and B are equal if, and only if, A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.
• A set A is not a subset of a set B, denoted A ⊈ B, if, and only if, there is an element of A that
is not an element of B.
• A set A is not equal to a set B if A is not a subset of B or if B is not a subset of A.
A set A is a proper subset of a set B, denoted A ⊂ B or A ⫋ B, if A ⊆ B and A ≠ B. In other
words, A is a proper subset of B if A is a subset of B and B is not a subset of A, i.e. if at least
one element of B is not in A. In particular, no set is a proper subset of itself. If A is not a proper
subset of B, we denote that by A ⊈ B.








\[a^*=x-b^*\]
\[ a^*=x-b^* \]
\[
a^*=x-b^*
\]

These are block equations using alternate delimiters:

$$a^*=x-b^*$$

$$ a^*=x-b^* $$

$$
a^*=x-b^*
