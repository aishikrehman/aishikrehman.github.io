title: "About me"
---
Greetings! My name is Aishik Rehman, and I am a computer science engineer and computational linguist based in Bangladesh. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Green University of Bangladesh.

## Background and Interests
My interest in computer science started at a very young age, and since then, I have been exploring various aspects of this field. However, I realized that I am most passionate about the intersection of human language and artificial intelligence. I find it fascinating how machines can be taught to understand and process natural language, and I am excited to contribute to this field.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I am an avid contributor to the Wikimedia community. I have been active in almost all multilingual Wikimedia projects, including Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and Wikidata. I am a skilled Scalable Vector Graphics artist, translator, and introvert. I have contributed to various Bengali translation projects and have served as an admin and interface admin on Bengali Wiktionary and interface admin on Bengali Wikibooks.

## Curriculum and Education
One of my key interests is in the study of curriculum across different countries, which has led me to explore and research education systems around the world. I have a particular fascination with the curriculums of countries in South Asia and have spent time studying and analyzing their approaches to education.

In my research, I have found that while the educational systems of different countries may vary, there are certain common themes that emerge across cultures. For instance, many education systems emphasize the importance of critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. I believe that by studying the curriculums of different countries, we can gain valuable insights into what makes for effective education, and how we can design educational programs that meet the needs of diverse populations.

## Wikimedia Contributions
As a passionate advocate for open knowledge and diversity, I have contributed to several feminist projects in the Wikimedia community. I served as the Main Coordinator for Wiki Loves Women South Asia 2021, where I successfully led an initiative to increase the representation of women on Wikipedia. I have also been a Regional Organizer for the Feminism and Folklore events in 2021, 2022, and 2023, where I developed effective strategies for promoting the representation of women and non-binary artists on Wikipedia.
