Inwriting this book, I was guided by my long-standing experience and interest in teaching
 discrete mathematics. For the student, my purpose was to present material in a precise,
 readable manner, with the concepts and techniques of discrete mathematics clearly presented
 and demonstrated. My goal was to show the relevance and practicality of discrete mathematics
 to students, who are often skeptical. I wanted to give students studying computer science all of
 the mathematical foundations they need for their future studies. I wanted to give mathematics
 students an understanding of important mathematical concepts together with a sense of why
 these concepts are important for applications. And most importantly, I wanted to accomplish
 these goals without watering down the material.
 For the instructor, my purpose was to design a flexible, comprehensive teaching tool using
 proven pedagogical techniques in mathematics. I wanted to provide instructors with a package
 of materials that they could use to teach discrete mathematics effectively and efficiently in the
 most appropriate manner for their particular set of students. I hope that I have achieved these
 goals.
 I have been extremely gratified by the tremendous success of this text. The many improve
ments in the seventh edition have been made possible by the feedback and suggestions of a large
 number of instructors and students at many of the more than 600 NorthAmerican schools, and
 at any many universities in parts of the world, where this book has been successfully used.
 This text is designed for a one- or two-term introductory discrete mathematics course taken
 bystudents in a widevariety of majors, including mathematics, computer science, and engineer
ing. College algebra is the only explicit prerequisite, although a certain degree of mathematical
 maturity is needed to study discrete mathematics in a meaningful way. This book has been de
signed to meet the needs of almost all types of introductory discrete mathematics courses. It is
 highly flexible and extremely comprehensive. The book is designed not only to be a successful
 textbook, but also to serve as valuable resource students can consult throughout their studies
 and professional life
