# Predicates and Quantifiers

In logic, **predicates** and **quantifiers** provide a more expressive framework than propositional logic. They allow us to reason about objects and their properties in more detail. This section introduces predicates, quantifiers, and how they are used in mathematical logic.

## 1. **Predicates**

A **predicate** is a statement or function that depends on one or more variables. It can be thought of as a statement that becomes a proposition once the variables are assigned specific values.

### Example:

- Let $$ P(x) $$ be a predicate: "x is an even number."
- If we substitute $$ x = 2 $$, then $$ P(2) $$ becomes the statement "2 is an even number," which is true.

The predicate $$ P(x) $$ is a function from a domain (the set of all possible values for $$ x $$) to the set of truth values (True or False). A predicate is often written in the form $$ P(x) $$, where $$ x $$ is a variable.

## 2. **Quantifiers**

Quantifiers are symbols used to express the extent of a statement. In predicate logic, there are two main types of quantifiers:

### **Universal Quantifier ( $$ \forall $$ )**

The universal quantifier, denoted by $$ \forall $$, asserts that a predicate is true for all elements in a particular domain.

### Example:

The statement "All even numbers are divisible by 2" can be written as:

$$
\forall x (P(x) \implies Q(x))
$$

Where:
- $$ P(x) $$: "x is an even number"
- $$ Q(x) $$: "x is divisible by 2"
- $$ \forall x $$: "For all x"

This reads as: "For all $$ x $$, if $$ x $$ is an even number, then $$ x $$ is divisible by 2."

### **Existential Quantifier ( $$ \exists $$ )**

The existential quantifier, denoted by $$ \exists $$, asserts that there exists at least one element in the domain for which a given predicate is true.

### Example:

The statement "There exists an even number greater than 10" can be written as:

$$
\exists x (P(x) \land x > 10)
$$

Where:
- $$ P(x) $$: "x is an even number"
- $$ \exists x $$: "There exists at least one $$ x $$"

This reads as: "There exists an $$ x $$ such that $$ x $$ is an even number and $$ x $$ is greater than 10."

## 3. **Combining Predicates and Quantifiers**

Predicates and quantifiers can be combined to express complex statements. You can also use logical connectives (such as $$ \land $$, $$ \lor $$, $$ \neg $$) along with quantifiers.

### Example 1: Universal Quantifier with Conjunction

The statement "All even numbers greater than 0 are divisible by 2" can be written as:

$$
\forall x (P(x) \land x > 0 \implies Q(x))
$$

This reads as: "For all $$ x $$, if $$ x $$ is an even number and $$ x $$ is greater than 0, then $$ x $$ is divisible by 2."

### Example 2: Existential Quantifier with Disjunction

The statement "There exists an even number less than 0 or an odd number greater than 10" can be written as:

$$
\exists x (P(x) \land x < 0) \lor (Q(x) \land x > 10)
$$

Where:
- $$ P(x) $$: "x is an even number"
- $$ Q(x) $$: "x is an odd number"
- $$ \exists x $$: "There exists at least one $$ x $$"

This reads as: "There exists an $$ x $$ such that $$ x $$ is an even number and $$ x $$ is less than 0, or $$ x $$ is an odd number and $$ x $$ is greater than 10."

## 4. **Quantifier Negation**

Negating statements involving quantifiers follows specific rules:

- The negation of a universal statement becomes an existential statement:  
  $$ \neg (\forall x \, P(x)) \equiv \exists x \, (\neg P(x)) $$

- The negation of an existential statement becomes a universal statement:  
  $$ \neg (\exists x \, P(x)) \equiv \forall x \, (\neg P(x)) $$

### Example:

The negation of "All students passed the exam" is "There exists a student who did not pass the exam."

In logical terms:

$$
\neg (\forall x \, P(x)) \equiv \exists x \, (\neg P(x))
$$

Where:
- $$ P(x) $$: "x passed the exam"
- $$ \forall x $$: "For all x"
- $$ \exists x $$: "There exists at least one x"
- $$ \neg P(x) $$: "x did not pass the exam"

This reads as: "There exists an $$ x $$ such that $$ x $$ did not pass the exam."

In conclusion, **predicates** and **quantifiers** are essential tools in formal logic, enabling the expression of statements about objects and their properties. Understanding how to use them allows for precise and powerful logical reasoning.
