# Lesson: Sets in Discrete Mathematics

## 1. What is a Set?
A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects inside a set are called **elements** or **members**. Sets are fundamental objects in mathematics and are used to define other mathematical concepts, such as functions, relations, and more.

### 1.1. Notation of Sets
A set is usually represented by listing its elements inside curly braces `{}`. For example:
- $$ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $$ means a set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.
- $$ B = \{a, b, c\} $$ is a set containing the elements `a`, `b`, and `c`.

We can also describe sets by properties, without listing all elements. For example:
- $$ A = \{ x \mid x \text{ is a positive integer less than 5} \} $$ describes the set $$ A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $$.

### 1.2. Types of Sets
There are different types of sets, depending on their properties:

- **Finite Set**: A set with a specific, countable number of elements.  
  Example: $$ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $$
  
- **Infinite Set**: A set with an unlimited number of elements.  
  Example: $$ B = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} $$, which is the set of natural numbers.

- **Empty Set (Null Set)**: A set with no elements.  
  Notation: $$ \emptyset $$ or $$ \{\} $$

- **Singleton Set**: A set containing only one element.  
  Example: $$ C = \{5\} $$

- **Universal Set**: A set that contains all the elements under consideration for a particular context.  
  Example: If the set $$ U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} $$ represents all elements, it is called the universal set in that context.

- **Power Set**: The set of all subsets of a set $$ A $$. If $$ A = \{1, 2\} $$, the power set of $$ A $$ is $$ P(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\} $$.

### 1.3. Set Operations
Sets can be combined or compared using various operations:

- **Union ( $$ \cup $$ )**: The union of two sets $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ contains all elements that are in $$ A $$, in $$ B $$, or in both.  
  Notation: $$ A \cup B $$

- **Intersection ( $$ \cap $$ )**: The intersection of two sets $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ contains all elements that are in both $$ A $$ and $$ B $$.  
  Notation: $$ A \cap B $$

- **Difference ( $$ - $$ )**: The difference of two sets $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ contains all elements that are in $$ A $$ but not in $$ B $$.  
  Notation: $$ A - B $$

- **Complement ( $$ A^c $$ )**: The complement of a set $$ A $$ contains all elements not in $$ A $$, within a universal set.  
  Notation: $$ A^c $$

- **Symmetric Difference**: The symmetric difference of two sets $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ contains all elements that are in either $$ A $$ or $$ B $$, but not in both.  
  Notation: $$ A \Delta B $$

#### Example Operations:
If $$ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $$ and $$ B = \{2, 3, 4\} $$:
- $$ A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $$
- $$ A \cap B = \{2, 3\} $$
- $$ A - B = \{1\} $$
- $$ B - A = \{4\} $$

### 1.4. Venn Diagrams
A **Venn diagram** is a way of picturing sets and their relationships. It uses circles to represent sets, and the relationships between sets are shown by the positions and overlaps of the circles.

#### Example:
Consider two sets $$ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $$ and $$ B = \{2, 3, 4\} $$. The Venn diagram shows the union, intersection, and difference between these sets.

### 1.5. Cardinality of a Set
The **cardinality** of a set refers to the number of elements in the set. If $$ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $$, then the cardinality of $$ A $$ is 3, written as $$ |A| = 3 $$.

- **Finite Sets**: Cardinality is the count of elements.
- **Infinite Sets**: The cardinality of an infinite set is described by different types, such as countable and uncountable.

### 1.6. Set Equality
Two sets are considered **equal** if they contain exactly the same elements.  
For example:
- $$ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $$
- $$ B = \{3, 2, 1\} $$

Even though the elements are written in a different order, $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are equal sets because they contain the same elements.

## 2. Set Theory in Practice
Sets are used in various branches of mathematics and computer science, such as:
- **Logic**: Propositional logic and predicates are often described using sets.
- **Database Theory**: Operations like joins, unions, and intersections are used to query databases.
- **Graph Theory**: Vertices and edges are often modeled as sets.
- **Computer Algorithms**: Set operations form the basis of many efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimizing data.

Understanding set theory is essential for working with more advanced topics in mathematics, computer science, and many other fields.
