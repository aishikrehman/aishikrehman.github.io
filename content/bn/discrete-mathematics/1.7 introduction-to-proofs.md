# Introduction to Proofs

In mathematics and logic, **proofs** are the fundamental means of establishing the truth of a statement. A proof is a logical argument that demonstrates the truth of a given proposition based on previously established axioms, theorems, or premises. The ability to construct and understand proofs is a crucial skill in mathematics, computer science, and other logical disciplines.

## 1. **What is a Proof?**

A **proof** is a sequence of logical steps that lead from a set of premises or axioms to a conclusion. The purpose of a proof is to establish the truth of a proposition beyond any doubt, based on accepted principles of logic and reasoning.

In formal logic, a proof might use various **rules of inference** to derive new statements from existing ones. These rules ensure that the steps taken in the proof are valid, and the conclusion reached is logically sound.

## 2. **Types of Proofs**

There are several types of proofs commonly used in mathematics and logic:

### **Direct Proof**

In a direct proof, we start with known information (axioms, premises, or previously proven theorems) and use valid logical steps to directly prove the statement.

#### Example:

Prove that if $$ n $$ is an even integer, then $$ n^2 $$ is also even.

**Proof:**
- Let $$ n $$ be an even integer. By definition, there exists an integer $$ k $$ such that $$ n = 2k $$.
- Now, calculate $$ n^2 $$:
  $$
  n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)
  $$
- Since $$ n^2 = 2(2k^2) $$, it is divisible by 2, and hence $$ n^2 $$ is even.

### **Indirect Proof (Proof by Contradiction)**

In a proof by contradiction, we assume the opposite of what we want to prove and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Once we reach a contradiction, we can conclude that the original statement must be true.

#### Example:

Prove that $$ \sqrt{2} $$ is irrational.

**Proof:**
- Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $$ \sqrt{2} $$ is rational. Then it can be expressed as $$ \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} $$, where $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ are integers with no common factors (i.e., $$ \frac{a}{b} $$ is in lowest terms).
- Squaring both sides:
  $$
  2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \implies a^2 = 2b^2
  $$
- This means $$ a^2 $$ is even, so $$ a $$ must also be even.
- Let $$ a = 2k $$ for some integer $$ k $$. Substituting into the equation:
  $$
  (2k)^2 = 2b^2 \implies 4k^2 = 2b^2 \implies 2k^2 = b^2
  $$
- This shows that $$ b^2 $$ is also even, so $$ b $$ must be even.
- But this contradicts the assumption that $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ have no common factors (since both are even).
- Therefore, $$ \sqrt{2} $$ cannot be rational, and must be irrational.

### **Proof by Contrapositive**

A contrapositive proof involves proving the contrapositive of a statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. For a statement of the form "If $$ P $$, then $$ Q $$", the contrapositive is "If not $$ Q $$, then not $$ P $$".

#### Example:

Prove that if $$ n^2 $$ is odd, then $$ n $$ is odd.

**Proof:**
- The contrapositive of this statement is: "If $$ n $$ is even, then $$ n^2 $$ is even."
- Let $$ n $$ be an even integer. Then $$ n = 2k $$ for some integer $$ k $$.
- Now calculate $$ n^2 $$:
  $$
  n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2
  $$
- Since $$ n^2 = 4k^2 $$, it is divisible by 2, and therefore $$ n^2 $$ is even.
- This proves the contrapositive, and hence the original statement is also true.

### **Proof by Induction**

Mathematical induction is a method used to prove statements about integers, typically involving a statement that holds for all natural numbers. Induction consists of two steps:
1. **Base Case:** Prove the statement for the smallest value (usually $$ n = 0 $$ or $$ n = 1 $$).
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for some $$ n = k $$, and prove it for $$ n = k + 1 $$.

#### Example:

Prove that the sum of the first $$ n $$ integers is given by the formula:
$$
1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

**Proof:**
- **Base Case:** For $$ n = 1 $$, the sum is $$ 1 $$, and the formula gives:
  $$
  \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \frac{1(2)}{2} = 1
  $$
- **Inductive Step:** Assume the formula is true for some $$ n = k $$, i.e., 
  $$
  1 + 2 + \dots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
  $$
- We need to prove the formula for $$ n = k + 1 $$:
  $$
  1 + 2 + \dots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
  $$
- Using the inductive hypothesis:
  $$
  \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
  $$
- Therefore, the formula holds for $$ n = k + 1 $$, and by induction, it holds for all $$ n $$.

## 3. **Conclusion**

Proofs are an essential part of mathematics and logic. They serve as the foundation for establishing the validity of statements and theorems. Mastering the various methods of proof, including direct proof, contradiction, contrapositive, and induction, is crucial for anyone studying formal mathematics and logic.
