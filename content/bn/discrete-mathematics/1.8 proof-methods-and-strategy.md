# Proof Methods and Strategy

In mathematics and logic, proving a statement is not only about applying a formula or following a mechanical process. It involves thinking strategically, selecting the appropriate proof method, and structuring the argument in a clear and logical way. In this section, we will explore various proof techniques and strategies to help approach and construct rigorous proofs.

## 1. **Choosing the Right Proof Method**

When confronted with a statement to prove, selecting the most effective proof method is crucial. Here are some common strategies:

### **Direct Proof**

A **direct proof** begins with known facts, axioms, or previously proven theorems, and proceeds step-by-step to establish the truth of the statement directly.

- **Strategy**: Identify what is given and what needs to be shown. Try to connect the known facts logically to the conclusion.
- **When to use**: If the problem is straightforward and does not involve assuming the negation or contrapositive.

#### Example:
Prove that the sum of two even numbers is even.

**Proof**:
- Let the two even numbers be \( a \) and \( b \), so by definition, \( a = 2k \) and \( b = 2m \) for some integers \( k \) and \( m \).
- The sum of \( a \) and \( b \) is:
  $$
  a + b = 2k + 2m = 2(k + m)
  $$
- Since \( a + b = 2(k + m) \), the sum is divisible by 2, and therefore it is even.

### **Proof by Contradiction**

In a **proof by contradiction**, we assume that the statement we want to prove is false, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

- **Strategy**: Assume the negation of the statement. Use this assumption to derive a contradiction with known facts, theorems, or axioms.
- **When to use**: When it is easier to assume the opposite of what you are trying to prove and show that it leads to an inconsistency.

#### Example:
Prove that \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational.

**Proof**:
- Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that \( \sqrt{2} \) is rational. Then it can be expressed as \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).
- Squaring both sides:
  $$
  2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \implies a^2 = 2b^2
  $$
- This means that \( a^2 \) is even, so \( a \) must be even.
- Let \( a = 2k \). Substituting into the equation:
  $$
  (2k)^2 = 2b^2 \implies 4k^2 = 2b^2 \implies 2k^2 = b^2
  $$
- This shows that \( b^2 \) is even, so \( b \) must be even.
- But both \( a \) and \( b \) being even contradicts our assumption that \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime.
- Hence, \( \sqrt{2} \) must be irrational.

### **Proof by Contrapositive**

A **contrapositive proof** involves proving the contrapositive of a statement. The contrapositive of a statement "If \( P \), then \( Q \)" is "If not \( Q \), then not \( P \)", and these two statements are logically equivalent.

- **Strategy**: Instead of proving "If \( P \), then \( Q \)", prove the contrapositive, "If not \( Q \), then not \( P \)".
- **When to use**: When the contrapositive is easier to prove.

#### Example:
Prove that if \( n^2 \) is even, then \( n \) is even.

**Proof**:
- The contrapositive of this statement is: "If \( n \) is odd, then \( n^2 \) is odd."
- Let \( n \) be odd, so \( n = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
- Then,
  $$
  n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
  $$
- Since \( n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 \), it is odd.
- Therefore, if \( n \) is odd, \( n^2 \) is odd, and the contrapositive is true. Thus, the original statement is also true.

### **Mathematical Induction**

**Mathematical induction** is a method used to prove statements about integers. It is particularly useful for proving statements involving a sequence or series of numbers.

- **Strategy**: Show that the statement holds for the base case (usually \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 1 \)). Then, assume it holds for \( n = k \) and prove it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
- **When to use**: When proving statements about integers, especially those that can be recursively defined.

#### Example:
Prove that for all \( n \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:
$$
1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

**Proof**:
- **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \),
  $$
  1 = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1
  $$
  So, the base case holds.
- **Inductive Step**: Assume the formula holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., 
  $$
  1 + 2 + \dots + k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
  $$
- We need to prove it holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
  $$
  1 + 2 + \dots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}
  $$
- Using the inductive hypothesis:
  $$
  \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + \frac{2(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}
  $$
- Thus, the formula holds for \( n = k + 1 \), and by induction, it holds for all \( n \).

## 2. **General Strategies for Constructing Proofs**

### **Breaking Down Complex Problems**

When faced with a complex proof, break it down into simpler steps:
- Identify the components of the statement and prove them separately.
- If needed, introduce intermediate lemmas (helpful theorems that lead to the main result).

### **Use of Counterexamples**

A **counterexample** can be a powerful tool in disproving a statement. A counterexample shows that a general statement is false by providing an example where the statement does not hold.

#### Example:
Prove or disprove: "All prime numbers are odd."
**Counterexample**: 2 is a prime number, but it is even. Therefore, the statement is false.

## 3. **Conclusion**

Proofs require both logical thinking and creativity. Choosing the right method of proof is essential, and a good proof often involves a mix of different techniques. Mastering these techniques takes practice, but by developing a systematic approach to proof construction, one can become proficient in proving mathematical statements. Whether through direct proofs, contradiction, induction, or contrapositive arguments, the goal is always to establish the truth of the statement in a clear and logically sound manner.
