Fuzzy logic is used in artificial intelligence. In fuzzy logic, a
proposition has a truth value that is a number between 0 and 1,
inclusive.A proposition with a truth value of 0 is false and one
with a truth value of 1 is true. Truth values that are between 0
and 1 indicate varying degrees of truth. For instance, the truth
value 0.8 can be assigned to the statement “Fred is happy,”
because Fred is happy most of the time, and the truth value
0.4 can be assigned to the statement “John is happy,” because
John is happy slightly less than half the time. Use these truth
values to solve Exercises 45–47.
45. The truth value of the negation of a proposition in fuzzy
logic is 1 minus the truth value of the proposition. What
are the truth values of the statements “Fred is not happy”
and “John is not happy?”
46. The truth value of the conjunction of two propositions in
fuzzy logic is the minimum of the truth values of the two
propositions. What are the truth values of the statements
“Fred and John are happy” and “Neither Fred nor John is
happy?”
47. The truth value of the disjunction of two propositions in
fuzzy logic is the maximum of the truth values of the two
propositions. What are the truth values of the statements
“Fred is happy, or John is happy” and “Fred is not happy,
or John is not happy?”
∗48. Is the assertion “This statement is false” a proposition?
∗49. The nth statement in a list of 100 statements is “Exactly
n of the statements in this list are false.”
a) What conclusions can you draw from these statements?
b) Answer part (a) if the nth statement is “At least n of
the statements in this list are false.”
c) Answer part (b) assuming that the list contains 99
statements.

town who can be reached only by traveling a dangerous
mountain road shaves those people, and only those people, who d
