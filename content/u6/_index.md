This is more or less the sound you would make if you had bad catarrh and the doctor asked to look at your throat. The two new consonants in this unit introduce you to one of the most important consonantal distinctions to be found in the languages of South Asia. In Unit 2, it was stressed that the consonant dwas dental: made by pressing the tongue against the upper teeth. It is essential to pronounce Bengali dental consonants correctly, so as to distinguish them from a corresponding set of retroflex or'cerebral' consonants, made by pressing the tongue against the rear edge of the hard 'alveolar ridge' behind the upper teeth. 'Cerebral', implying the pointing of the tongue up towards the cerebral cortex, is considered to be an archaic term now; 'retroflex', implies the curling of the tip of the tongue backwards. Neither term is very appropriate to Bengali, because the tongue is not curled round or pointed vertically upwards as in some South Asian languages; but the consonants in question are nevertheless quite distinct from the dental consonants. Failure to distinguish dental from retroflex consonants is often parodied in Bengali novels, when Englishmen are shown trying to speak Bengali (or Hindi). This is rather like stereotyped Chinese in English novels confusing 'l' with 'r', or Germans pronouncing'w' as'v'.
