1. Practise sayng the words and phrases overleaf with the help of the cassette or the previous few pages. In this and in all the first (sound) exercises in Units I to 12, you need not worry about analysing the grammar. By the end of the book, you will be able to do so, and you'll know about distinctions between, for example, the different pronouns for he and she. For the moment, however, concentrate on producing the right sound, and on picking up vocabulary items - particularly nouns and adjectives. You have already seen the first four words:

* am fnango amra niini ue did not take
* ma mother amra niina we do not take
* na no, not am anun Bing (some)
* nam runne fnangos.
* ga body nun nii? May I tnke (some)
* gan song salt?
* arnar rry nin na Please take (some).
* abar again ini amar ma She is my mother.
* bagan gardnn uni amar mama He is mY
* ami I (matemal) uncle.
* nun salt amar nam raul My nnme is
* ini helshe Raul.
* uni helshe amar rumd nin Take mY
* rumaf handkerchief handkerchief.
* nil blue uni umar baba? Is he Uma's
* lal red father?
* m[l root na, uni rimir baba No, he's
* ami anini I did not bring Rimf s father.
* amianlam I brough

2. Now see if you can write the words and phrases above in Bengali script. If a vowel comes between two consonants, it is always thought of as 'belonging' to the consonant before, not the consonant that follows. Thus amar is written a-mar, not am-ar: qNr< If a vowel follows a vowel, it has to be written as a full voweL so niina is written ni-i-na: nETt The sequence r followed by u as in rumal generally has a special letter-form, perhaps because tlte ordinary vowel sigrr for u (*) would interfere with the dot in K: <+B= * t however, does occur in some modern typefaces. Keys to this and subsequent exercises are on pp. 278-293.
